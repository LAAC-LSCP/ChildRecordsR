\description{
Provide indication of quality for each annotator.
Following classical test theory, each annotator is removed from the data and a reliability indicator is provided for the annotation as a whole.
Removing a good annotator should decrease the indicator.
Additionally, a mean of precision, recall and F-score are provided by rater.
